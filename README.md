## Setup

Customize the terminal by searching for _TODO's_ in the code.
Implement terminal commands in `main_page.dart` by changing `_handleCommand()`.
By calling methods on `TerminalController` you can request terminal input during
command handling. See the methods initial implementation for example usage.
